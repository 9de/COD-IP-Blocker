# COD IP Blocker — Windows Firewall Script

This repository contains a **Windows CMD script** that allows you to block specific IP ranges for a given game executable (e.g., *Call of Duty HQ*).  
It uses **Windows Defender Firewall** to block outbound connections from the game binary to selected IP ranges.
